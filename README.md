# Linux Administration Automation Script

## Overview  
This is a Bash script designed to simplify common Linux system administration tasks. The script provides an interactive menu for performing operations such as managing user accounts, monitoring processes, killing processes, and installing software. It’s a great tool for beginners learning Linux administration and for automating repetitive tasks.

## Features  
- **Add User**: Create a new user with a home directory and default shell. Automatically checks if the user already exists before adding.  
- **List All Processes**: Displays all running processes on the system in a detailed format using the `ps` command.  
- **Kill Process**: Terminate a process by its name using the `pkill` command.  
- **Install Program**: Install software packages interactively using `apt`.  
- **Quit**: Exit the script gracefully.  

## Requirements  
- Linux-based system (tested on Ubuntu/Debian).  
- Bash shell (default in most Linux distributions).  
- Sudo privileges for adding users, killing processes, and installing programs.
