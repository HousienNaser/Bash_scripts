## How to Use

1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the script to a file, e.g., `system_manager.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x system_manager.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./system_manager.sh
   ```
   - **Note**: Some operations (e.g., user management, service management) require root privileges, so run the script with `sudo`.

4. **Navigate the Menu**:
   - The script presents a main menu with options for each functionality.
   - Use the number keys to select an option and follow the prompts.

## Global Variables

- `BACKUP_DIR="/tmp/backups"`: The directory where backups are stored. You can modify this path if needed.

---

## Notes
- **Backups**: Backups are stored in `/tmp/backups` by default. Ensure this directory exists or modify the `BACKUP_DIR` variable.
- **Logs**: The log viewer requires the full path to the log file (e.g., `/var/log/syslog`).
- **Permissions**: Some operations (e.g., user management, service management) require root privileges.
